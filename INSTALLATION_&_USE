# intro_curve_fitting_python
DMM's introduction to the use of python for curve fitting. 
Written for the Colbert Lab at NDSU, with best wishes. 

**
Prerequisites:

This package requires python3, and jupyter notebook. At NDSU, these are 
available on thunder, and may be readily installed on other platforms. Platform-
specific installation instructions are easily googlable. If you need to install
either of these, get started here for python:

https://www.python.org/

and here for jupyter:

https://jupyter.org/

These instructions are for installing the package using the linux command line,
and they assume a basic familiarity with how to use it. However, both python and 
jupyter are operating-system agnostic, and, provided Windows syntax is used for 
specifying directory and file names, it should be possible to run these notebooks 
on Windows machines. 

**
Installation from the tgz archive:

On the linux command line change into the directory in which you wish to place the
parent directory of this installation, and copy the intro_curve_fitting_python.tgz 
file into that directory. Execute:

tar -zxvf intro_curve_fitting_python.tgz

**
Launching jupyter notebook:

Change into the intro_curve_fitting_python directory, and from the command line, execute:

jupyter notebook

This should open a new tab called 'Home' in your browser showing the contents of the
directory. You may click on any directory or file to open it. Jupyter notebooks have
".ipynb" file extensions. The first time you use the software, you should start with
the "start_here.ipynb" and proceed through the various notebooks in the order in which
you are guided through them.
