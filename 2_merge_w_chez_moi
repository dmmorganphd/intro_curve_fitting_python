Once uploaded to github:

this github package is now updated with respect to the branch currently 
under revision chez moi. To merge correctly:

mv the clone which is presently chez moi into a tarchive elsewhere on the system
delete the .../gh/intro_curve_fit_python package entirely from chez moi
reclone the package chez moi from this github source
untarchive the package from chez moi _over_ this newly recloned package chez moi
git add *
git commit -m "installation de chez moi"
git push origin main
